# Industrial Streaming Architecture

Industrial environments generate **continuous, high-velocity operational data** from PLCs, sensors, robots, MES systems, and industrial gateways.  
To build a **real-time smart factory**, this data must be processed as **streams rather than batches**.

This blueprint describes a **production-grade Industrial Streaming Architecture** that enables:

- Real-time machine monitoring
- Predictive maintenance
- Digital twin updates
- Quality anomaly detection
- Event-driven manufacturing systems

This architecture is designed for **scalability, resilience, and operational observability** in modern smart factories.

# 1. Why Streaming Architecture in Manufacturing

Traditional manufacturing systems rely heavily on **periodic batch processing**.

Typical legacy flow:

PLC → SCADA → Historian → Batch ETL → Analytics

Problems:

- High latency (minutes to hours)
- Poor real-time visibility
- Limited event-driven automation
- Difficult scalability

Industrial streaming solves these limitations.

This enables:

- millisecond-level data propagation
- event-driven manufacturing
- real-time operational intelligence

# 2. High-Level Architecture

A scalable **Industrial Streaming Architecture** typically consists of the following layers.
![Industrial Streaming Architecture](/assets/img/blueprints/industrial-HighLevel-architecture.png){: .shadow }

Each layer has a **clear responsibility boundary**, which is critical for maintainability.

---

# 3. Industrial Data Ingestion Layer

The ingestion layer connects **OT environments to the IT data platform**.

## Common Industrial Protocols

| Protocol | Purpose |
|--------|--------|
| OPC-UA | Industrial interoperability |
| MQTT | Lightweight IoT messaging |
| Modbus | Legacy industrial communication |
| Profinet / EtherNet/IP | Real-time industrial networking |

Example gateway flow:

PLC → OPC-UA → Edge Gateway → MQTT → Kafka

Typical edge stack:

Industrial Device
│
▼
Edge Gateway
  ├ OPC-UA Collector
  ├ MQTT Client
  ├ Protocol Converter
  └ Local Buffer

Edge buffering is essential to handle **network interruptions**.

---

# 4. Streaming Platform (Kafka Backbone)

The streaming backbone provides **durable event streaming**.

Common choices:

- Apache Kafka
- Redpanda
- Pulsar

Typical Kafka cluster architecture:

![Industrial Streaming Architecture](/assets/img/blueprints/Kafka cluster architecture.png){: .shadow }

Key Kafka configuration concepts:

### Topic Design

Example topics:

factory.machine.telemetry
factory.machine.events
factory.quality.metrics
factory.energy.usage


### Partition Strategy

Partition by:

machine_id
production_line
factory_site


This enables **parallel stream processing**.

---

# 5. Stream Processing Layer

Streaming processing enables **real-time computation**.

Typical frameworks:

| Framework | Use Case |
|---------|---------|
| Kafka or Apache Flink | complex event processing |
| Kafka Streams | lightweight streaming |
| Spark Structured Streaming | large-scale pipelines |

Example real-time analytics:

Machine Telemetry Stream

Window Aggregation
│
▼
Anomaly Detection
│
▼
Alert Event


Example Flink processing flow:

Kafka Topic
│
▼
Stream Processor
├ Window Aggregation
├ Pattern Detection
├ Feature Extraction
└ ML Inference
│
▼
Output Streams

# 6. Real-Time Manufacturing Use Cases

Industrial streaming architectures enable **multiple high-value capabilities**.

### 6.1 Predictive Maintenance

Sensor Data → Feature Extraction → ML Model → Failure Prediction

Benefits:

- Reduced downtime
- optimized maintenance schedules

---

### 6.2 Real-Time OEE Monitoring

Streaming enables continuous OEE computation.

Vision System Events

▼
Streaming Processor
│
▼
Defect Pattern Detection
│
▼
MES Alert

---

### 6.4 Digital Twin Synchronization

Physical Machine State
│
▼
Streaming Platform
│
▼
Digital Twin Update

This keeps the **digital model synchronized with the factory floor**.

---

# 7. Data Storage Strategy

Streaming architectures typically use **multiple storage systems**.

Streaming Data
│
▼
Hot Storage → Real-time analytics
│
▼
Warm Storage → Operational reporting
│
▼
Cold Storage → Historical analysis

Example stack:

| Layer | Technology |
|-----|------|
| Hot | ClickHouse / Druid |
| Warm | RDBMS(Mysql,OpenDataBase, etc |
| Cold | Data Lake (AWS S3 / HDFS) |

---

# 8. Reliability and Fault Tolerance

Industrial systems require **high availability**.

Key design strategies:

### At-Least-Once Delivery

Producer → Kafka → Consumer


Messages are **never lost**, but duplicates may occur.

### Exactly-Once Processing

Supported by:

- Kafka transactions
- Flink checkpointing

### Edge Buffering

Edge gateways should provide **local persistence**.

---

# 9. Observability for Streaming Systems

Streaming platforms require **strong monitoring**.

Typical metrics:

- consumer lag
- message throughput
- processing latency
- error rates

Monitoring stack example:

Kafka Metrics → Prometheus → Grafana


Alert examples:

- consumer lag > threshold
- processing latency spike
- broker disk usage

---

# 10. Security Considerations

Industrial streaming systems must protect **both IT and OT environments**.

Key security layers:

Device Authentication
│
▼
Encrypted Transport (TLS)
│
▼
Kafka Authentication (SASL)
│
▼
Access Control (ACL)

Network segmentation is strongly recommended.

# 11. Reference Technology Stack

Example production stack:

| Layer | Technology |
|------|-----------|
| Edge Gateway | MQTT |
| Streaming | Apache Kafka |
| Processing | Apache Flink |
| Storage | Timeserise + ASW S3 |
| Monitoring | Prometheus + Grafana |
| Orchestration | Kubernetes |

---

# 12. Key Architecture Principles

A robust industrial streaming architecture should follow these principles:

### Event-Driven Design

Everything is modeled as **events**.

MachineStarted
MachineStopped
QualityAlert
MaintenanceRequired

---

### Decoupled Systems

Producers and consumers remain independent.

Producer → Kafka → Multiple Consumers

---

### Scalability by Partitioning

Throughput grows with **topic partitions and processing nodes**.
